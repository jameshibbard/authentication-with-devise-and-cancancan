<h1>Welcome to MyStore™</h1>
<h2>Supplying unnecessary objects to discerning procrastinators since 2020</h2>
<p>
  At MyStore™, we specialise in products you didn’t ask for, solving problems you don’t really have. From elegantly useless kitchen gadgets to beautifully confusing tech accessories, we’re here to complicate your life with style.
</p>
<p>
  Our mission? To ensure your shelves are full, your drawers are cluttered, and your bank account just slightly emptier than it was five minutes ago. Because nothing says satisfaction like a parcel you forgot you ordered.
</p>
<p>
  We understand your needs. Or at least we pretend to. That’s why we’ve created a shopping experience that’s slick, efficient, and only mildly intrusive. You click, we ship. You regret, we thrive.
</p>
<p>
  So settle in, scroll aimlessly, and add with abandon. MyStore™: because owning things is easier than finding meaning.
